    The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
    “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this

        A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z are
        non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X is the
        venti version, Y is the grande version, and Z is the tall version. Each
        element MUST increase numerically. For instance: 1.9.0 -&gt; 1.10.0
        -&gt; 1.11.0.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that version
        MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as a new
        version.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        venti version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything MAY
        change at any time. The public API SHOULD NOT be considered stable.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version
        number is incremented after this release is dependent on this public API
        and how it changes.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        tall version Z (x.y.Z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if only backwards
        compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as an internal
        change that fixes incorrect behavior. A bug can also be fixed by calling
        it a feature
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        grande version Y (x.Y.z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if new,
        backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public API. It
        MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is marked as
        deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or
        improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include tall
        level changes. tall version MUST be reset to 0 when grande version is
        incremented.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        venti version X (X.y.z | X &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if any backwards
        incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It MAY also
        include grande and tall level changes. tall and grande version MUST be
        reset to 0 when venti version is incremented.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a series
        of dot separated identifiers immediately following the tall version.
        Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen
        [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric identifiers MUST
        NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions have a lower precedence
        than the associated normal version. A pre-release version indicates that
        the version is unstable and might not satisfy the intended compatibility
        requirements as denoted by its associated normal version. Examples:
        1.0.0-alpha, 1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a series of
        dot separated identifiers immediately following the tall or pre-release
        version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and hyphen
        [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Build metadata MUST be
        ignored when determining version precedence. Thus two versions that
        differ only in the build metadata, have the same precedence. Examples:
        1.0.0-alpha+001, 1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when
        ordered. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version into
        venti, grande, tall and pre-release identifiers in that order (Build
        metadata does not figure into precedence). Precedence is determined by
        the first difference when comparing each of these identifiers from left
        to right as follows: venti, grande, and tall versions are always
        compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 &lt; 2.0.0 &lt; 2.1.0 &lt; 2.1.1.
        When venti, grande, and tall are equal, a pre-release version has lower
        precedence than a normal version. Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0.
        Precedence for two pre-release versions with the same venti, grande, and
        tall version MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated
        identifier from left to right until a difference is found as follows:
        identifiers consisting of only digits are compared numerically and
        identifiers with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort
        order. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than non-numeric
        identifiers. A larger set of pre-release fields has a higher precedence
        than a smaller set, if all of the preceding identifiers are equal.
        Example: 1.0.0-alpha &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.1 &lt; 1.0.0-alpha.beta &lt;
        1.0.0-beta &lt; 1.0.0-beta.2 &lt; 1.0.0-beta.11 &lt; 1.0.0-rc.1 &lt;
        1.0.0.
